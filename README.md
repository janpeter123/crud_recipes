# C.R.U.D Recipes

## About the development

This is a recipe web application developed with the `mobile first` concept. So the mobile application was developed first and optimized to small screens, the smallest screen that it was developed was an `Iphone SE` that is not one of the smallest phones on the market today.
For the Desktop version it was developed and tested only on a `13" monitor`. I tried to develop based on relative measures, this way it shouldn't be a big issue if you try to execute on a different screen size.

## What an user can do

A user can create and rate any recipe without the need of logging in but only the admin user can delete or update recipes. Such as names or descriptions.
